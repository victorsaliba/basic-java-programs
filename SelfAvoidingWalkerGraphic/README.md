## Cat escape

A cat is in the center of a city (represented by a N x N grid). The cat cannot go to a position it has already visited and moves step by step, allowed to go up, down, left or rigth randomly. If the cat reaches the city's border, it runs away.

The program simulates this process T times and print the total number of steps the cat has taken.
