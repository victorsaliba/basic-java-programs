## Guess the biggest number

Here we consider two versions of a simple game:

Version 1: Given two aleatory integers between 0 and 99, we choose one of them. If the chosen number is, in fact, the biggest number, then we win, otherwise we lose.

Version 2: Given two aleatory integers between 0 and 99, we choose one of them and then we say what is the largest number. If the number is, in fact, the biggest number, then we win, otherwise we lose.

The objective of the program is apply a strategy that makes the probability of win on the version 2 is larger than the probability of win in version 1.
